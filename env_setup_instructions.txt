To set up virtual env with requirements, run the following commands:
git clone <blahblahblah> directory_name
cd directory_name
virtualenv venv
<windows shell> venv\scripts\activate
<bash shell> . venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

this will get you in the virtual environment with all the dependencies

make sure to name the virtualenv folder "venv" or the .gitignore here won't filter it out when looking for files to add/commit, or just modify your local .gitignore to ignore the venv folder
